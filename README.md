<h1> Starbucks-Capstone-Challenge </h1>
<h1> Udacity Data Science Capstone project </h1>
<h2> Overview </h2>
This article is about my work on the Capstone project of Udacity Data Science program. I worked on the dataset provided by Starbucks. The dataset was collected for a program to create a data simulates how people make purchasing decisions and how those decisions are influenced by promotional offers.
Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks.

[This](https://medium.com/@sh.sheikhakbari/starbucks-customers-responds-to-different-offers-fa1f08eead53) is the article published to 
explain my solution to this capstone challenge in more detail.

  <li>profile.json - demographic data for each customer</li>
  <li>transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed</li>
</ol>
<h2> How to Run </h2>
